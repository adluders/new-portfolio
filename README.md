# Portfolio

Most recently updated portfolio site built with [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io)

The main goals of this site are to highlight

1. My Favorite projects
2. Some Tips to help other developers out that I've found helpful
3. A blog featuring me writing about random things
