I have read and tried different types of time management techniques but the one that works for me the best has been time-block planning. All it involves is setting up a dedicated time throughout your day which is strictly dedicated to a specific thing, coding for example. Time-block planning is all about dedication and focus which leads to massive productivity. Trust me, give it a shot and you will thank me later!

So many times, things like Twitter or other developer spaces will show you how much a person is doing with their days and it's often tough to not compare yourself to that and want to be like them. As a result, you end up overdoing it, coding 24/7 and not give yourself adequate time to rest and take breaks in between. Factor breaks into your coding or learning sessions. You will love it in the long run!"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"}],"id":"-494c17ca-567e-5e07-b27d-c85405398ff8","tip":"Proper breaks"}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1942088059"]}
