I learned about the beauty and benefits of pseudocoding, planning before coding. Having that understanding lead to me having less repeated code in my work. I also learned how to develop coding habits. The Photosnap project had a lot of quirks, beside the multiple pages. I learned how to adjust when different errors came up. One specific one I remembered encountering was making the grids responsive. While it seems easy on the surface, making a 4 item grid responsive proved to be quite challenging for me.
